### Welcome to the Swiss Architecture Knife's (`swark`) GitHub organization!

Are you annoyed that your software architecture documentation is outdated? Are you unhappy with your current documentation solution, e.g. because of licensing model changes or being force-pushed to the cloud? Do you want to include regulatory requirements such as the European Union's NIS2 in your architecture documentation?

Then you've come to the right place. `swark` supports you and your team in documenting the architecture of your software landscape. With the help of the flexible data model, you can define and expand the architecture in a structured way and later enrich it with additional information.

Your team will have fun writing documentation by making your architectural ivory tower transparent and public.
